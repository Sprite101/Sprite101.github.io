Hi, We're Team Koprulu a group of modders working to create the highest quality StarCraft content that we're able to make. We currently have our sights set on recreating the entirety of StarCraft 1 and it's campaigns in the StarCraft 2 Engine.

At this time we're even including two additional spinoff projects: one is our Crossover Mod a mod capable of pitting the sc1 and sc2 races together in as even a playing field as we can craft and the Legacy mod, a total conversion that completely replaces the sc2 races with their BroodWar counterparts recreating all the original mechanics and unit stats.

Our Campaign offering which is currently under development will include new Units, Abilities, Upgrades, Heroes, a brand new Progression System, Redesigned Missions and Terrains as well as a host of new features and changes to the Campaigns, You can download the Demo in our Mapster Page. 

We'd like for people to join us in our journey as we work to deliver the Ultimate BroodWar Remake.
