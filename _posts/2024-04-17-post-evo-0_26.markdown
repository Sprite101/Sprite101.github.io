### Lurker
* Burrow time reduced from 2.5 -> 2.0 (slower than SC2 lurker with Adaptive Talons)
* Increased weapon range from 7 to 8
* Lurker +3 damage to light (Allows lurkers to kill sc1 marines in two attacks again)

### Queen
* Temporarily disabled sc2 Command Centers being able to be targeted by Queens Infest ability

* Spawn Broodling will fail if target goes into stasis
* Disruptor, Colossus, Sentry, Reaver, Probes & Widow Mine now have robotic attribute

_This damage change keeps the Starcraft 1 interactions intact, (with the exception of defensive matrix) while targets like Thor and SC2 Ultralisk now require two casts to be killed by Queens_

### Spore Colony
* Spore Colony damage increased 15 -> 25
* Spore Colony weapon range increased 7 -> 8

### Carrier
* Implemented SC1 Carrier inteceptor behaviours quirks (Thanks to m0ebiuz!)
* Interceptors can only enter Carrier while it is stationary
* Interceptors will now retreat to the carrier if they are at 0 shields
* Interceptors will now repair their shields and life when inside the carrier
* Interceptors can only exit the carrier when life is above 20 
_The shield regen rate is comparable to shield battery instead of instant heal. Special checks have been done to allow them to exit with plague_
* The area which Interceptors circle around target has been increased
* Interceptor weapon speed reduced 1.554 -> 1.875 
* Interceptors launch delay from Carrier increased from 0.5 -> 0.625
* Fixed SC1 Interceptor weapon incorrectly displaying 2 attacks in it's weapon
* Raven Scrambler Missile now disables Carrier weapon correctly

### Ghost
* New Ghost model for SC1 ghost
* Hold Fire and Weapons Free buttons can now be mapped to same hotkey

### Vulture & Spider Mine
* Spider Mine now visually tilts on uneven ground
* Increased volume of Spider Mine Burrow and Chase sounds
* Increased Spider Mine model visual scale by 15%
* Spider Mine now has correct initial burrow delay when placed
* Spider Mine can now target undetected burrowed targets same as cloaked units
* Spider Mine can't target enemy spider mines (they still deal damage to own and other spider mines if exploding near them)
* Reduced the time spider mine re-burrows after unburrowing
* Spider Mine placement range reduced from 0.6 -> 0.5
* Spider Mine now takes priority over other units when targeting units in the same location
* Spider Mine now have same attack target priority as other units
* Vulture now has short delay before placing mines, plays an "animation" after it has been placed. 
_This is mimicing the vulture behavior in sc1 and should prevent usage of the spider mine in fights without penalty_
@Kat add gif of the new placement "animation" & maybe the burrowed roach targeting?

### Irradiate

* AI players will now try to avoid irradiated targets

@Kat add gif here of the new irradiate burrowed visual
