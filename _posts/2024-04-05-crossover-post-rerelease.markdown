## Evo Crossover Release 1.0

Today we celebrate the release of the SC Evo Crossover Edition mod, this mod is a much more in-depth update of the old SC1 vs SC2 Extension mod including some new units, abilities and upgrades as well as a much better balanced AI.

We want to start this new post on our new site by publishing the patchnotes for our upcoming Update 1.0 to the Crossover Edition as well as thank everyone who has made this project possible and all the love and passion we've seen from the Korean community that inspire this update, without further ado below are the update notes as well as some comments from the dev team on how or why some changes were made.

_For starters we've made several adjustments to the game balance of all three races to have a much more even fighting chance against their sc2 counterparts as well as removed several features that are exclusive to the legacy and campaign versions of the game._

* Removed bonus damage vs Shields from Explosive and Concussive Weapons
* Reworked Damage bonuses across most SC1 Units
* Reworked SC1 Unit Attributes

_These changes are aimed at making the weapons across both races compatible allowing the sc2 damage bonuses to work on sc1 units and vice versa._

* Adjusted all Armor and Weapon Upgrade times to comply with the newest balance patch
* Adjusted all Vespene Collector costs to comply with the newest balance patch

_From the feedback we received on the terran sc1 vs sc2 balance some of the comments pointed out at the lack of a way to improve the unit production speed, while we do not yet have a solution we're exploring a couple options and if you have a suggestion feel free to drop it in the Discord._

* Added Dropship Emergency Boost Upgrade at the Control Tower
* Added Dropship Emergency Boost Ability

_The new upgrade for the Dropship works in a similar way as the sc2 medivac but requires a previous research at the Control tower for 100 minerals and 100 vespene, allowing the Dropship to receive a temporary boost to leave sticky situations or make for quick drop-ins._
