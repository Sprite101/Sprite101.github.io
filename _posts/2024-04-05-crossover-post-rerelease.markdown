## Evo Crossover Release 1.0

Today we celebrate the release of the SC Evo Crossover Edition mod, this mod is a much more in-depth update of the old SC1 vs SC2 Extension mod including some new units, abilities and upgrades as well as a much better balanced AI.

We want to start this new post on our new site by publishing the patchnotes for our upcoming Update 1.0 to the Crossover Edition as well as thank everyone who has made this project possible and all the love and passion we've seen from the Korean community that inspire this update, without further ado below are the update notes as well as some comments from the dev team on how or why some changes were made.

_From the feedback we received on the terran sc1 vs sc2 balance some of the comments pointed out at the lack of a way to improve the unit production speed, while we do not yet have a solution we're exploring a couple options and if you have a suggestion feel free to drop it in the Discord._
