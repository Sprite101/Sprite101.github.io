## Evo Crossover Release 1.0

Today we celebrate the release of the SC Evo Crossover Edition mod, this mod is a much more in-depth update of the old SC1 vs SC2 Extension mod including some new units, abilities and upgrades as well as a much better balanced AI.

We want to start this new post on our new site by publishing the patchnotes for our upcoming Update 1.0 to the Crossover Edition as well as thank everyone who has made this project possible and all the love and passion we've seen from the Korean community that inspire this update, without further ado below are the update notes as well as some comments from the dev team on how or why some changes were made.

_For starters we've made several adjustments to the game balance of all three races to have a much more even fighting chance against their sc2 counterparts as well as removed several features that are exclusive to the legacy and campaign versions of the game._

* Removed bonus damage vs Shields from Explosive and Concussive Weapons
* Reworked Damage bonuses across most SC1 Units

_From the feedback we received on the terran sc1 vs sc2 balance some of the comments pointed out at the lack of a way to improve the unit production speed, while we do not yet have a solution we're exploring a couple options and if you have a suggestion feel free to drop it in the Discord._

* Added Dropship Emergency Boost Upgrade at the Control Tower
* Added Dropship Emergency Boost Ability
_The new upgrade for the Dropship works in a similar way as the sc2 medivac but requires a previous research at the Control tower for 150 minerals and 150 vespene, allowing the Dropship to receive a temporary boost to leave sticky situations or make for quick drop-ins._

* Added the Ability for Bunkers to be Salvaged
* Increase Ghost Damage from 5 (10 vs Light) -> 8 (16 vs Light)
* Combined the Terran Vehicle and Starship Armor Upgrades into Terran Mech Plating

_Protoss Race General State_

* Added Gateway Resonant Matrix Upgrade at the Citadel of Adun
* Added Gateway Resonant Matrix Passive Ability
_This new upgrade is meant to address an issue with the late game unit production for the protoss, it can be researched at the Citadel of Adun for 200 Minerals and 200 Vespne, requires the Templar Archive and allows Gateways to produce two units at the same time._

*Resonant Matrix GIF?*

* Added the Ability for Observers to Morph into Surveillance Mode
_Observers entering Surveilance Mode gain a much larger vision range at the cost of losing the ability to move until they're turned back to Observer mode._

*Observer Surveillance GIF?*

* Reduced Dragoon Damage from 15 (10 vs Armored) -> 14 (19 vs Light)

* Reduced Dark Archon Feedback Damage per energy from 1 -> 0.5

* Added a Weapon to the High Templar
* Added a Weapon to the Dark Archon

_Although Dark Archons and High Templars do not usually have weapons one has been added with very low damage to help them from walking straight into the enemy_

_Zerg Race General State_

* Added Queen Ensnaring Creep Ability
* Removed Queen Ensnare Ability
_Queens have received a modified ability replacing Ensnare, this Ability variant launches a mix of creep and the classic green goo to slow down enemies as well as create a Creep patch around the target aream this ability has several uses such as giving your units a temporary speed boost or using it as part of a Nydus Proxy._
